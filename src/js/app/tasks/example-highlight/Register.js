        <h3> with our search engine!</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>The study consists of three phases: a questionnaire, a search phase and another questionnaire.</p>
        
        <p> Each questionnaire contains questions about one or more topics&mdash;please answer the questions truthfully. 
        Your payment is <b>not</b> affected by the number of correct or incorrect answers. 
        Most questions are multiple-choice questions. In the second questionnaire we ask you to write a summary  too.

        <h3> <img src ="/img/experiment.png" width="50" height="50"> The experiment  </h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>During the search phase we want you to use our custom search engine (which provides access to a large portion of the web) to learn about one topic &mdash;you will find a description of your topic on the right-hand side of the search interface. 
       <br>
        Our search interface has a number of user interface elements that help you to learn and search&mdash;we will introduce them to you on the next screen. </p>
        <p>You are required to search for web pages, read them and learn about a topic for at
        least 20 minutes&mdash;our interface has a timer, so you can see how much time you already spent searching. 
        After 20 minutes you can move on to the final questionnaire by clicking on the <span style="background-color: #00A6D3"><font color="white">To Final Test</span></font> button. 
        If you prefer, you can also keep searching for a bit longer and then move on.</p>

        <p> Imagine that you are searching the web with that particular information need in mind. You can use our SearchX system to issue queries and examine a series of documents for researching about your information need.  After providing us with some basic demographics information, we will present the search interface.</p>
        <ol type="-">
            <li>
                <p>  Use SearchX just as you would your chosen web search engine. Issue as many queries as you like, and examine whatever documents you like.

                <p>You can interact with the search results. 
                    A click on a document link will open the selected document in our own document viewer. 
                    We know that this document viewer is not perfect, but please stick with it. In the document viewer you will have access to the highlighting tool.

            <li>
                <p> Your highlights and notes taken during the search session will be avaiable to you during the final questionnaire. However, you will NOT be able to take more notes or highlight documents during then.

            <li> 
                <p>
                Keep the queries you issue on point, and relevant to the topic outline provided on the right of the search interface.
                For example, please do not issue queries for a prior topic once you have begun the search process for a new topic. 
                If you begin issuing queries that are totally off topic (e.g. queries on ice skating, Brexit, or anything else you can think of), we will cancel your participation.

            </li>
            <li>
            <p> Once you have completed your exploration, click <span style="background-color: #00A6D3"><font color="white">To Final Test</span></font> button. Note that it will be only activate after 20 minutes.
